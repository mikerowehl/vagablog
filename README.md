Vagablog
========

Blog client for PalmOS devices (ie. Treo650).

Technically open source, but this is an old project.
Probably not useful for anything, but I had the source
around and I didn't want to lose it. Just in case. And I think it's
interesting just in terms of nostalgic/sentimental value. To understand how
far things have come.
